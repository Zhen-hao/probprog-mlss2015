#  Probabilistic programming practical materials

This is NOT the original repo. It is a copy of the code available in https://bitbucket.org/probprog/mlss2015/raw/aa10c392733811aacf441f7b0fce8d6640db0372/docs/getting-started/anglican-getting-started-guide.pdf 

## MLSS 2015

There is a [getting started guide](docs/getting-started/mlss-specific.pdf) which explains how to get up and running with Anglican.

After installing everything, there is a [Hello World!](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=bitbucket&user=probprog&repo=mlss2015&path=beta-flip/hello-world-worksheet.clj)
worksheet that teaches you enough Clojure and [Anglican](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood)  to
get started with the included exercises.  

There are four exercises that we recommend you do in the following order:

 1 [Gaussian](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=bitbucket&user=probprog&repo=mlss2015&path=gaussian/gaussian-worksheet.clj)
 2 [Physics](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=bitbucket&user=probprog&repo=mlss2015&path=physics/physics-worksheet.clj)
 3 [Traces](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=bitbucket&user=probprog&repo=mlss2015&path=traces/poisson-trace-worksheet.clj)
 4 [Coordination](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=bitbucket&user=probprog&repo=mlss2015&path=coordination/coordination-worksheet.clj).
	
Having finished these you both should be able to program in Anglican 
and have developed reasonable intuitions about how probabilistic programming systems work.
